*Tools Used: Python*

*Data Used: [Amazon E-Commerce Sales](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/unlock-profits-with-e-commerce-sales-data/data?select=Amazon+Sale+Report.csv)*

*Business Insights:* We can utilize python to visualize trends and find key metrics that are important in analyzing how a business is doing and how it may perform. In this case, we will be analyzing Amazon clothing sales in India to assess how this category of the business is performing. By understanding which products and sizes sell best, we can acquire more customers through advertising and increase profits. By analyzing the cashflow, we can better allocate resources and quickly determine which actions are producing the best results. 

*Plan of Action:* We will first extract, prep, and clean the data. In doing this, we can drop duplicate values, fill null values, and remove any unwated columns and rows. We can then group and aggregate the data to find many different key metrics such as revenue by product category, total canceled orders, and top selling products by city. We will utilizie Matplotlib to visaulize the data and showcase trends.

In Q2 2022 gross revenue for clothing has decreased by 9-10% month to month. This is an alarming rate of decrease and should be compared with past quarters and years to see if these fluctuations are normal. The average monthly revenue for this quarter was $279,717.

Despite decreasing revenues, the average order value increased by 6.1% from April to June. This means that the volume of orders has decreased. Is this a seasonal trend? Have price increases on products contributed to less sales? If so, how have profit margins changed?

The set makes up over 50% of revenues yet sales have been decreasing month to month. Is this seasonal? Why is the trend changing? Sales of the western dress increased 32% from April to June. With their high price point and increasing sales performance, prioritizing the sale of these products can build a more resilient and diversified business.
